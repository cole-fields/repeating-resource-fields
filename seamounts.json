Boundaries for the OPB seamounts were defined and produced using geoprocessing analyses in ArcMap.\r\n\r\nThere are now 62 seamounts known or predicted to occur in the OPB, of which 43 are newly identified and unnamed (UN)\u2014ten more since the last inventory: four seamounts listed in DFO 2019 were removed from the inventory (for various reasons) and 14 new UN seamounts were discovered. To mark the significance of seamounts as part of our geographical and cultural environment, DFO Science is working in partnership with the 17 coastal First Nations (Nuu-chah-nulth, Quatsino, Haida, and Pacheedaht First Nations) to name the new discoveries and update the Canadian Gazetteer (interim nomenclature: \u201cUN\u201d followed by two digits). The locations and depths of seamounts were determined using available databases and bathymetry models, which have varying degrees of accuracy. Using recently collected bathymetry (single- and multi-beam), the location and depth of 34 seamounts (21 newly identified) have been confirmed.\r\n\r\nForty-seven seamounts are in the Area of Interest (AOI; 76%), three are in the SGaan KinghlasBowie Marine Protected Area (SK-B MPA; 5%), and 12 seamounts are outside of the conservation areas (19%). Thirty-six of the 47 AOI seamounts are currently protected by a fisheries closure. There are additionally hundreds to thousands more seamount-like knolls and hills in the OPB that do not meet the seamount criteria of \u22651 km elevation (e.g., Seminole \u201cseamount\u201d; DFO 2019).", "name": "seamounts", "notes": "Seamounts have been identified as Ecologically or Biologically Significant Areas (EBSAs) due to their unique oceanography and ecology; they frequently serve as sites for fisheries and as habitat for a number of species of conservation concern.

We used several pre-existing spatial databases and predictive models to map all named seamounts within Canada\u2019s Exclusive Economic Zone, all named seamounts fished by Canada in international waters, and any predicted (modelled) unnamed seamounts in adjacent waters.
